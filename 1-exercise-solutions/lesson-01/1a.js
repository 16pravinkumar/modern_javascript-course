alert('Good morning!');

// why we use alert in JavaScript ?

// The `alert` function in JavaScript is used to display a simple pop-up dialog box with a message to the user. It is often used for providing immediate information, warnings, or notifications to the user when interacting with a web page. It can be helpful for debugging, validating input, or conveying important messages, but it is generally considered a user experience design practice to use it sparingly, as excessive alerts can be disruptive to the user's experience.
