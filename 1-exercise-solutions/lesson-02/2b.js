// what does this (10 + 3 * 8 + 5) / 3
// represent in js

// In JavaScript, the expression `(10 + 3 * 8 + 5) / 3` represents a mathematical calculation. It follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), where multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction. 

// Here's how the expression is evaluated step by step:

// 1. `3 * 8` is calculated first, resulting in `24`.
// 2. Then, `10 + 24` is calculated, resulting in `34`.
// 3. Finally, `34 + 5` is calculated, resulting in `39`.
// 4. The final result, `39`, is divided by `3`, which equals `13`.

// So, `(10 + 3 * 8 + 5) / 3` evaluates to `13` in JavaScript.
